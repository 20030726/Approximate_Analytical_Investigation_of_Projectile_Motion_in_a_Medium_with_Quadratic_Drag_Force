# Approximate Analytical Investigation of Projectile Motion in a Medium with Quadratic Drag Force

This project implements an **Approximate Analytical Solution** to estimate the quadratic drag coefficient in 2D projectile motion.

## Project Files
- **PPT File**: Provides a detailed description of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, and results.
- **Code File**: Contains the MATLAB code used for the **Approximate Analytical Solution** to estimate the quadratic drag coefficient.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to estimate the quadratic drag coefficient by applying an Approximate Analytical Solution. The system models 2D projectile motion under the influence of quadratic drag, and the solution is derived through an inverse approach to fit the observed trajectory data.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (version R2023a or later)
